<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ol><li><strike>Crashes under IE8 -- will be fixed.</strike></li><li>Sometimes a long word list will get eaten -- not sure why</li><li><strike>The challege stuff isn't working properly.  it should give people exactly the same board at (more or less) the same time.</strike></li><li>Challenge mode should be working now.  Click 'Challenge!' to start a challenge, then to accept a challenge just click on the 'Accept Challenge' button in the post.<li>Thanks to a player, I found out that a recent change at SOI broke the game room (You got redirected to the room home page on entering game  mode).  This is now fixed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Quick how to play</h2>
<p><b>After you click on the first letter, you can only use a letter that is TOUCHING the last letter you played.  It can be up, down, side to side or diagonal -- but it must be touching.</b></p>
<p>Feel free to start a game, any number of people can play at once without interrupting each other.  Accepting a challenge just gives all of the players (of that challenge) the same dice setup.</p>
