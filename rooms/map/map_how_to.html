  <h1>The Map Editor Software for SOI</h1>
  
  <h2>The boring stuff</h2>
  <p>Right now, this program is still somewhat
  experimental and NOT ready for prime time use.</p>
  
  <p>Permission to  use this map program AT SOI is granted,
  so long as my name remains intact.</p>
<hr>  
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>The map viewer works by taking a regular image file with
  no writing on it, and then reads through a list of names
  and places, and writes various legends on the map.  In 
  theory, this makes updating the map very easy compared to
  the older method of actually having to change the graphic.</p>
  
  <p>There are several parts of map viewer system, and all
  of them must be in place.</p>
  
 <dl>
<dt>makeseebutton.js</dt>
<dd>This file must be included on any page that will link
to the map page.</dd>

<dt>mapedit.html</dt>
<dd>This is the image map viewer and editor</dd>

<dt>map_show.js</dt>
<dd>The driving force behind mapedit.html</dd>

</dl>

  <h3>How to install it</h3>
<p>These directions assume you are fairly comfortable with HTML 
and basic file editing.</p>

<p>Upload the following files to whichever room will be
hosting the map viewer</p>
<ol>
<li>makeseebutton.js</li>
<li>map_show.js</li>
<li>mapedit.html</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit <code>madeseebutton.js</code> and edit the variable 
<code>URL_TO_MAP_PAGE</code> to refer to the 
<code>mapedit.html</code> that you just uploaded.</p>

<p>In any room that will link to the map file, go to room
controls and make the following two changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add 
<br><code>&lt;script src="PATH_TO_YOUR_ROOM/makeseebutton.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
<br>It doesn't matter where you add it.
</li>
<li>Whereever you would like a link to the map file, add this code:
<br><code>&lt;span id="putSeeMapHere"&gt;SeeMapWillGoHere2&lt;/span&gt;</code>
<br>You may only add this once per room.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have the map viewer/editor installed, go the room
that has the link to the map viewer and hit 'view map.'  You
will see a rather basic map with just a few entries on it.</p>

<p>I'm not going to detail how to use the editor here, it should
be fairly simple to work out. Once you have your new rooms areas added,
click on the <code>Generate Javascript</code> and then cut-and-paste
the given code into the file <code>map_show.js</code>, just overwriting
the data that is there -- NOT the entire file.</p>
