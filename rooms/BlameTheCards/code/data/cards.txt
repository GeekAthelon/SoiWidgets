If my mother served _, I would eat it.
  the head of John the Baptist
  a dead cat
  two wet teabags
  meatloaf
The perfect day would be partly cloudy with sudden chance of _.
  wind-blown kilts
  falling Daleks
  castor oil
  Nazis
The best thing about _ is that they can _.
  babies
  Nuns
  Germans
  rubber-band guns
  break glass with their breath
  weeble down the street
  break-dance on a bed of nails
  sing my praises
