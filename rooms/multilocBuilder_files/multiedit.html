    <h1>The SOI MultiLoc builder</h1>

    <p>These are the instructions on how to use Athelon's multi-location room builder.</p>

    <h2>What you'll need.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An empty room -- or one you are willing to screw up while learning.</li>
        <li>A small understanding of HTML</li>
        <li>The willingness to play around with experimental and not totally tested code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparing the room.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create a blank room. You'll need to remember the room name (include the @ tail) to
            fill it into a setup script later.</li>

        <li>Download the <a href="https://soiroom.hyperchat.com/multiloc/multi.js">multi.js</a>            file. Important note: You will need to right-click on the file and choose
            <code>Save Target As</code> or whatever your browser calls that option.
            <br>
            <strong> Due to a strange quirk, your system may attempt to name this file
            <code>multi.js.jpg</code>.  That is NOT correct.  This is a JavaScript file with the
              extention of <code>.js</code>
            </strong><br> Upload this file to your room. </li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Setting up the embed points</h3>

    <p>With the room created, there are four embed points that need to be filled in.
        Go to the SOI Control Panel, Rooms, then choose the room you are creating.
    </p>

    <p>There are four entries that have to be made here. Most of these can be directly
        copied from the list below and filled into the correct spot. There are two
        important changes that must be made. In the <code>Text for Bottom of the Room</code>,
        the URL (the piece that begins with <code>https</code> must be changed to
        point to YOUR files. You can get this address from the FTP_FILES section
        of SOI. The address MUST begin with <code>https</code>. If it begins with
        <code>http</code>, you'll have to change it yourself.</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Location on SOI room configuration page</th>
            <th>Text to enter</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Room Text Left Side Chat Box</td>
            <td>
                <code>
                &lt;div id=chatleft&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=roomlist&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Room Text Under Chat Box</td>
            <td><code>&lt;div id=underchat&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Text for Top Level of Room</td>
            <td><code>&lt;div id="roomtop"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Text for Bottom of Room</td>
            <td>
                <code>
                  &lt;div id="roombottom"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  <br>
                  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://CHANGEME/multi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                  <br>
                  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://CHANGEME/config.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
              </code>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>If you want to have additional things that will NOT change with each view, you
        may also enter them into the room at this time. If you are going to use triples,
        they must be set up here. Its a limitation of how the system works.
    </p>

    <h2>Generating your views</h2>

    <p>Open <a href="https://soiroom.hyperchat.com/multiloc/multiedit.html">the builder up</a>        in a separate window or tab.</p>

    <strong>If you do NOT have a config file</strong>

    <p>If you do not have a configuration file already, you'll need to create a blank
        one by pressing the <code>Load Blank Data</code> button.</p>

    <strong>If you do have a config file</strong>

    <p>If you do have a configuration file already, you will need to cut-and-paste it
        into the entry box for on this screen</p>

    <strong>Once the entry box is filled, press <code>Next&gt;&gt;</code></strong>

    <h3>Creating the views</h3>

    <p>Creating the views is very similar to the process of creating rooms at SOI. You
        can add, remove and edit the views on this screen. If there are no views,
        enter a view name into the text area field, click the <code>Add</code> radio
        button then press <code>MakeChange</code>.</p>

    <p><i>This name is only used by the system. It is NOT the name that will
          show up in the room drop-down list.</i></p>

    <p>If you have an existing view to change, click on the view name
    </p>

    <h3>Adding/Editing Views</h3>

    <p>Editing the view data here is very similar to working with SOI room information.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>Name of this view:</code> This is the name of the view that will appear
            in the drop down list.
        </li>
        <li><code>Full URL to background image for this view </code> If this view has
            its own background, enter it here. <em>Note: Using triples keeps
          this background from appearing.  Think of it like this is the "floor"
          of your room and putting triples is is like putting carpets over the floor.
          The floor might change, but you'll never see it.</em></li>
        <li><code>Room Text Left Side Chat Box </code> Like SOI</li>
        <li><code>Room Text Under Chat Box </code> Like SOI</li>
        <li><code>Text for Top Level of Room  </code> Like SOI</li>
        <li><code>Text for Bottom of Room  </code> Like SOI</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Press <code>Save</code> when finished.</p>

    <h3>Setting the defaults</h3>

    <p>When you have all of your views created, click <code>Finish up</code> to be taken
        to the last configuration page.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>Text color of location messages </code> The MultiLoc code adds an extra
            bit to every message posted saying which view it was posted in. You may
            chose the color of that message here. <em>This color will be used in all
              views, so you might want to make sure it contrasts with the background.</em>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>At the bottom of the screen there is a selection which allows to to chose the
        order that the views will appear in the views list. You can also set which
        view is the default view.
    </p>

    <p>When finished, click <code>Save</code>.</p>

    <h3>Copying the file to SOI</h3>

    <p>The builder does not have the ability to upload the file for you, so you will
        have to do it manually. Go to the rooms <code>FTP_Files</code> page and create
        a new file called <code>config.js</code>. (Note, this is the same file name
        we told the room we would be loading earlier.)</p>

    <p>When the new screen comes up, cut-and-paste the information from this window
        into SOI and click <code>Save</code></p>


    <h2>To do, some day</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set up messages as people leave a view or go into one.</li>
        <li>Clean up the editor so it just works smoother.</li>
        <li>Find the best way to not require refreshes on the room view. "?version=1"
            might work. Untested.</li>
        <li>Make these instructions neater.</li>
    </ol>
