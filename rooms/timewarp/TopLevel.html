            Outside the cabin of one Mr Athelon DeGeek. Here, outside the cabin,
            everything appears safe and normal.  If you haven't been inside the cabin yet,
            save yourself and go somewhere else.If you have escaped from the cabin,
            don't tempt fate -- again.

            Inside the cabin, the <i>Spirit List</i> is never quite right.  There may be no
            chatters, or there may be 10.  Either way, the count is wrong, for in this cabin
            lurks a spirit that never posts, but sometimes shimmers about for reasons only it
            -- formerly he or she -- knows.

            Day, nor night, matters here in the closet.  This small room, isolated from the rest of the
            rest of the cabin, eats light.  The <i>Spirit</i> is strongest here.  If the door could talk,
            it would explain why the words "HELP ME" have been carved with fingernails in the ancient
            wood.
